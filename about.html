            <h3 class="hello-kitty-bow">My Early Years</h3>
            <p>My early years were full of simple and happy memories. I spent most of my days playing outside, running around, and having fun with friends. As a child, I was very curious. I liked asking endless questions about everything. One of the best memories from my childhood was joining the McDonald's Kiddie Crew. 🍟✨</p>
            <p>It was such a fun and exciting experience. I got to wear a uniform, greet customers, and even help make meals. I felt so proud and happy being part of it. Even though my parents were busy and we were not rich, they gave me the best kind of love — the kind that doesn't need fancy things. We didn’t have much, but they always made sure I was safe, cared for, and happy. 
              I learned how to appreciate simple joys and to be thankful for what I had. Those early years taught me how to be strong, kind, and grateful. They were the beginning of my journey, and they helped shape me into who I am today. I will always carry those memories in my heart. 💖</p>

            <h3 class="paw-print">My Path as a Majorette</h3>
            <p>During my elementary years, I joined the Drum & Lyre group, and I became a majorette. I remember when I joined I was shy because I wasn't sure if I could do it. But I gave it a try, and I'm so glad that I did. I still remember the first time I held the baton. It felt strange at first, but I practiced every day. 🥁✨</p>
            <p>Being a majorette taught me how to be strong and proud. I performed in school events, parades, and special programs. Unfortunately, my body couldn't always keep up due to anemia, but the experience taught me courage, discipline, and the power of teamwork. 💃🌟</p>
            <p>Even if I couldn’t stay as a majorette for long, I still learned so much from the experience. I learned the value of courage, trying new things, and not being afraid to chase a dream — even if it doesn't last forever. My path as a majorette may have been short, but it was meaningful because it helped me grow. It gave me confidence
               and taught me that with hard work, I can achieve great things. It also reminded me to be strong, to listen to my body, and to be proud of what I can do — no matter what. I will always treasure that special chapter of my life.</p>

            <h3 class="hello-kitty-bow">Discovering My Passion</h3>
            <p>When I was younger, I wasn't sure what I really loved doing. But as I grew up, I started to discover the things that make me happy: dancing and anything about technology. I discovered dancing at the age of three when I joined in church as an animator. I loved moving to music and expressing myself through dance. Whether it was at school, 
               at home, or during events, dancing always made me feel alive and free. It helped me show my emotions without using words. When I dance, I feel confident and joyful. It’s one of the best ways I can express who I am. 💃🎵</p>
               <p>At the same time, I also became interested in technology. I liked using computers, exploring apps, and learning how things work. Both dancing and technology became a big part of my life. They may seem different, but they both make me feel excited and inspired. 💻✨</p>
               <p>They may be seems different, but they both make me feel excited and inspired. I know that as I continue to grow, I will keep learning and improving in these two things I love. They helped me understand myself better, and they continue to shape the person I want to become.</p>

            <h3 class="paw-print">Volunteer Vibes: A Journey of Purpose</h3>
            <p>At the age of 8, I wanted to learn how to play piano in church. But sadly, there was no piano instuctor in our church. Every Sunday, my mother would leave me in church. At first, I just sat and watched. But over time, other kids teach me how to dance the "Ama namin" or "Papuri sa Diyos". Slowly, I became a Volunteer until now. 🎹⛪</p>
            <p>When I turned 12, I joined RYM (Redemptorist Youth Ministry). It was a fun and life-changing experience. I met other young people who loved serving God, and I became more active in church. I joined events, activities, and later, I also became a dancer in praise and worship with my group ADP. At first, I was nervous, but dancing made me feel free, joyful, and close to Him. As time passed, I learned more and grew in faith. I was trusted with more responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I became a Youth Leader, and later on, a GA (General Assembly) for Missionary. It was not always easy, but I enjoyed every moment of serving God and helping others. One of the most memorable moments for me was when I portrayed Mary — the mother of Jesus — in a church presentation. I acted as Mary during the scene where her son died. It was a very emotional experience. I felt the pain and love that Mary had for Jesus. That moment helped me understand more 
              deeply the sacrifice of Jesus and the love of a mother. It touched my heart and made me more thankful for everything he did for us. Being a volunteer in church taught me so many things — like leadership, teamwork, faith, and humility. It helped me become a better person and gave me a purpose. Even though I didn’t become a pianist, I found other ways to serve with love and joy.🌟💕</p>

            <h3 class="hello-kitty-bow">Planting Seeds of Hope: My Missionary Life</h3>
            <p>I am part of the Apostolate Committee, a group with a mission to serve others and share God’s love. Sometimes we stay close to home, but many times we travel to far places to help people in need. One of the most memorable experiences I had was during our Pamaskong Handog. We visited different places to give food and gifts to families during Christmas. We also help those who are victims of typhoons and fires, bringing them comfort, support, and hope. Our mission is not just for people. 
              We also care for nature and animals. We join clean-up activities and learn how to protect God’s creation. We believe that everything God made is important and must be cared for.🎄💝</p>
            <p>We also have an activity called “Midnight Christ.” Every midnight, we go out and give food to people who are homeless and hungry. It’s a small way of reminding them that they are not forgotten and that someone cares. Even if it’s late and sometimes tiring, we do it with love and joy in our hearts. Last month, we went to Dumaguete to deepen our knowledge about mission. It was a beautiful experience. We met new people and were adopted by kind families — we had foster parents and siblings who made us feel at home. They guided us and helped us understand the true meaning of being a missionary.🙏✨</p>
            <p>Even though I love serving in the mission, I sometimes feel afraid. I fear being labeled as overly religious, out of touch, or even intrusive. These thoughts make me feel unsure. I also struggle with stepping out of my comfort zone. Doing God’s mission is not always easy — it asks me to take risks, face uncertainty, and sometimes make sacrifices. But even with these fears, I remind myself that I am not alone. God gives me strength, and I believe that every small act of love and service has a purpose. Little by little, I am learning to trust Him more and follow His mission with courage. 
              Being part of the Apostolate Committee taught me to be more loving, caring, and faithful. I learned that even small actions can plant seeds of hope in someone’s life. I will continue this mission with all my heart, sharing love, and bringing light wherever I go.</p>

            <h3 class="paw-print">High School Experience</h3>
            <p>My high school journey was filled with curiosity and learning. It's where I formed many lifelong values, learned responsibility, and built strong friendships. At first, I was shy and nervous. Everything felt new — new classmates, new teachers, and a new environment. But as time passed, I started to feel more comfortable. 🎒📚</p>
            <p>There were fun times, like field trips, school events, and bonding with classmates. But there were also hard times like projects, exams, and sleepless nights. My high school journey taught me how to be strong, how to work hard, and how to believe in myself. 🌟💪</p>

            <h3 class="hello-kitty-bow">My College Life</h3>
            <p>Being a college student is a big step, and taking the course of Information Technology (IT) made it more exciting and challenging for me. At first, I felt nervous. College life was very different from high school. As an IT student, I studied topics like computers, programming, and technology. 💻🎓</p>
            <p>Sometimes I feel like IT is not for me. I question myself and wonder if I can really do this. But even with those doubts, I keep going. Being an IT student is teaching me to be strong, to be patient, and to never give up. Maybe IT is hard, but that doesn't mean I can't do it. ✨💪</p>

            <h3 class="hello-kitty-bow">Where I Am Now</h3>
            <p>Right now, I am still growing and learning every day. I am not yet where I want to be, but I am on my way. I have gone through many experiences happy, sad, easy, and hard — and all of them helped me become who I am today. I am still a student and a servant of the Lord. I try my best to balance my studies with my service to God. Sometimes I feel tired, confused, or even unsure about my path. But I keep going because I believe that everything I’m doing now has a purpose. I know that each small step is part of a bigger journey.🌸📖</p>
            <p>I still have dreams I want to reach and goals I want to achieve. Sometimes I fail, but I learn. Sometimes I feel weak, but I pray and find strength again. Where I am now may not be perfect, but I am thankful. I have learned to be stronger, more patient, and more hopeful. I am still becoming the person I want to be, and that’s okay. My journey is far from over, but each chapter has built a stronger, more passionate version of myself.  💖✨</p>
